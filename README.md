## Getting Started



```
git clone  folder-name
```

First use npm install for both frontend and backend

Then cd into both directories and run npm Start 



```

cd backend
npm  install

check (package.json ) is in 

  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app",
    "dev": "nodemon app"
},

if(not exit means use these to start )
